## Project Overview

Forest fires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, property, and human lives. Predicting the extent of damage early can provide critical insights for emergency response teams and forest management authorities. This project:
- Analyzes historical forest fire data.
- Identifies key factors influencing the severity of fire damage.
- Develops predictive models to estimate damage levels.

## Objectives

- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  Build models that accurately forecast forest fire damage using environmental and weather data.

- **Data Insights:**  
  Understand the relationship between various factors (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed) and the extent of fire damage.

- **Support Decision-Making:**  
  Provide actionable insights to help authorities allocate resources effectively and plan preventive measures.

## Data Overview

The primary dataset used in this project contains historical records of forest fires, including:
- **Environmental Variables:** Temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
- **Fire Characteristics:** Area burned, intensity, etc.
- **Damage Metrics:** Quantitative measures of the damage caused.

The data has been preprocessed and cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and to ensure consistency for accurate model training.

## Methodology

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Data Cleaning:**  
  Handling missing values and outlier detection.
- **Visualization:**  
  Using plots and charts (e.g., scatter plots, histograms) to explore relationships between features and fire damage.
- **Statistical Analysis:**  
  Assessing correlations and distributions to identify key predictors.

### Feature Engineering
- **Variable Transformation:**  
  Creating new features that capture essential patterns in the data.
- **Normalization & Scaling:**  
  Ensuring all features contribute equally to the model training process.
- **Feature Selection:**  
  Identifying and selecting the most informative variables to enhance model performance.

### Modeling
- **Algorithm Selection:**  
  Experimenting with various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) to find the best fit.
- **Training & Validation:**  
  Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and using cross-validation techniques to ensure model robustness.
- **Performance Metrics:**  
  Evaluating model accuracy using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² scores.
